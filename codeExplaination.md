## CODE EXPLAINATION ##
1. **app.js Ln:11:** Express Session is Middleware which is like that memory for websites. When you log into a website, it creates a “session,” which is like a temporary memory card. This memory card helps the website remember who you are, what you’ve been doing, and any special settings you’ve chosen. So, if you go to a different page on the site or come back later, the website still knows it’s you,
2. **app.js Ln:12:** Flash is a temporary session-based storage for messages or data, used to pass info between requests(means you can send any info or data from one page to another as used in the following code), and cleared after being displayed once.
3. **app.js Ln:35:** ``app.set("view engine", "ejs");`` tells Express to use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the template/view engine. This allows you to render dynamic HTML pages by embedding JavaScript into your HTML files.
4. **app.js Ln:35:** Ab sari static files jese k images css waghera ko tum jb bhi jahan bhi import karo ge to un ka default route pehle se hi public tk ka ho ga ub ager tum kisi file ko public k andar kisi or folder jese k images k andar se provide karwana chahte ho to tumhe ``/images/abc.jpg`` ka route dena ho ga na k ``D:d/scatch/public/images/abc.jpg``
5. **app.js Ln:36:** ``express.json()`` middleware is used to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads. It reads the Content-Type header in the request ``(usually application/json)`` and automatically parses the JSON data into a JavaScript object, making it available in req.body.
6. **app.js Ln:37:** The ``express.urlencoded({ extended: true })`` middleware is used to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (like form data). Setting ``{ extended: true }`` allows for nested objects in the payload, which means it can handle complex data structures.(Yani jb hum kisi form ka data as req paas karte haen to us ko read karne men ye hamari madad kerta ha)
7. **app.js Ln:38:** The ``cookieParser()`` middleware parses cookies attached to the client request. It reads the Cookie header, parses it into an object, and makes the cookies available in req.cookies. This is useful for managing things like user sessions or preferences.
8. **indexRouter.js Ln:3:** const ``router = express.Router();`` creates a new instance of an Express router. The router acts like a mini Express app that can handle routes separately from the main app, allowing you to organize your routes more modularly. You can define routes and middleware specific to that router and then use it in your app.
9. **userRouter.js Ln:18:** populating the user's cart array with the products according to the id's stored in it for this request only not permanently.
10. **productRouter.js Ln:6:** importing upload from multerConfig.js, upload contains the configuration for Multer, a middleware used for handling file uploads in forms. The upload object will be used to manage file uploads, such as specifying the destination folder, file size limits, or file types.
11. **productRouter.js Ln:15:** ``upload.single('image')`` is a Multer middleware function that handles the upload of a single file with the field name image from a form. It processes the file and makes it available in req.file, After it you can access the file from req.file
12. **decodeToken.js Ln:1/userController.js Ln:2:** const ``jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')`` imports the jsonwebtoken library, which is used for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
13. **multerConfig.js Ln:1:** ``const multer = require("multer");`` imports the Multer library, which is used for handling file uploads in Express applications. Multer provides middleware for processing ``multipart/form-data``, which is commonly used for file uploads.
14. **multerConfig.js Ln:3:** ``const crypto = require("crypto");`` imports the built-in Node.js crypto module, which provides cryptographic functionality such as hashing, encryption, and decryption. It’s useful for tasks like creating secure hashes, generating random tokens, and encrypting data.
